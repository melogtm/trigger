# Trigger

## Overview
This project aims to create a clean, efficient shell. The current README was written quickly, but the code itself will be written without AI assistance. I plan to build the shell based on solid fundamentals and personal expertise.

## Goals
- Develop a functional, well‑structured shell.
- Ensure the shell is performant and easy to use.
- Continuously improve the project as I learn more.

## Learning Roadmap
To support development, I’ll study the following topics in my spare time:

- C programming language
- Linux system programming
- Shell scripting
- Data structures and algorithms
- Computer architecture and operating systems
- Memory management

## Inspiration
I’ll start by adapting the simple shell tutorial from Brennan Baker:

<https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/>

This will serve as a solid foundation, which I’ll later expand and customize. The resulting shell, named **Trigger**, will combine the tutorial’s core ideas with additional features and optimizations.

## Project Status
- Initial prototype based on the tutorial is under development.
- Future enhancements will be added incrementally as I deepen my understanding of the relevant topics.
